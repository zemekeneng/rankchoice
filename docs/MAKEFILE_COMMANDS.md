## Development Environment

### `make dev`
**Start the full development environment (blocking)**

Starts all services in the correct order and displays output in the terminal. This is a blocking command, so you'll see logs from all services but can't use the terminal for other commands.

```bash
make dev
```

**What it does:**
1. Checks dependencies
2. Starts Docker services (database, localstack, mailhog)
3. Waits for database to be ready
4. Starts backend and frontend in parallel
5. Shows output from all services

**Use when:** You want to see live output from all services during development.

### `make dev-bg`
**Start the full development environment in background**

Starts all services in background mode, freeing up your terminal for other commands.

```bash
make dev-bg
```

**What it does:**
1. Checks dependencies
2. Starts Docker services
3. Starts backend in background (logs to `logs/backend.log`)
4. Starts frontend in background (logs to `logs/frontend.log`)
5. Shows status of all services

**Use when:** You want to start everything and continue working in the terminal.

### `make stop`
**Stop all development services**

Stops all running services and cleans up processes.

```bash
make stop
```

**What it does:**
1. Kills cargo run processes (backend)
2. Kills npm run dev processes (frontend)
3. Stops Docker containers
4. Removes Docker networks

**Use when:** You're done developing or need to restart services.

### `make restart`
**Restart all services**

Equivalent to running `make stop` followed by `make dev-bg`.

```bash
make restart
```

**Use when:** Services are acting up or you've made configuration changes.

## Individual Services

### `make docker-up`
**Start database and supporting services**

Starts only the Docker containers (PostgreSQL, LocalStack, MailHog).

```bash
make docker-up

- MailHog (email testing) on ports 1025/8025

**Use when:** You only need the supporting services running.

### `make docker-down`
**Stop database and supporting services**

Stops all Docker containers.

```bash
make docker-down
```

```bash
make backend
```

**What it does:**
1. Changes to backend directory
2. Runs `cargo run`
3. Shows compilation and runtime output

**Use when:** You want to see backend logs directly or debug backend issues.

### `make backend-bg`
**Start the backend server in background**

Starts the backend server in background mode.

```bash
make backend-bg
```

**Output:** Logs are written to `logs/backend.log`

### `make frontend`
**Start the frontend development server (blocking)**

Starts the Svelte frontend server and shows output in terminal.

```bash
make frontend
```

**What it does:**
1. Changes to frontend directory

## Contributing

When adding new Makefile targets:

1. Add a description after `##`
2. Update this documentation
3. Test on clean environment
4. Consider cross-platform compatibility

Example:
```makefile
new-command: ## Description of what this command does
	@echo "Running new command..."
	# Command implementation
```
