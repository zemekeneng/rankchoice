## 🗳️ What is Ranked-Choice Voting?

Ranked-choice voting (RCV) is an electoral system where voters rank candidates in order of preference. Winners are determined through instant runoff rounds:
- **Single-winner**: Candidate needs >50% of votes to win
- **Multi-winner**: Multiple candidates can win based on vote thresholds

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- 🗳️ **Create RCV Polls** - Single-winner and multi-winner elections
- 👥 **Candidate Management** - Add, edit, reorder candidates with descriptions
- 🔗 **Secure Voting Links** - Unique ballot tokens for each voter
- 📊 **Real-time Results** - Live vote tabulation with round-by-round visualization
- 📱 **Mobile-Responsive** - Optimized for all devices

### Authentication & Security
- 🔐 **JWT Authentication** - Secure user registration and login
- 🛡️ **Route Protection** - Authenticated-only access to sensitive areas
- 🔑 **Password Security** - Argon2 hashing for maximum security
- 🚫 **Fraud Prevention** - Ballot validation and duplicate vote protection

### User Experience
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Beautiful Tailwind CSS design with Svelte 5
- ⚡ **Fast Performance** - Optimized Rust backend and reactive frontend
- 📋 **Form Validation** - Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- 🔄 **Poll Preview** - Preview polls before publishing
- 📈 **Dashboard** - Comprehensive poll management interface

### Developer Experience
- 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing** - 59 backend tests + 17 E2E tests
- 🛠️ **Development Tools** - Automated Makefile workflows
- 📚 **Complete Documentation** - API specs, guides, and examples
- 🐳 **Docker Setup** - Containerized development environment

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Rust with Axum framework
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit with Svelte 5 and TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLx migrations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (18+)
- [Docker](https://docker.com/) & Docker Compose
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (usually pre-installed)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/rankchoice.git
   cd rankchoice
   ```

2. **Start the development environment**
   ```bash
   make dev-bg
   ```
   
   *For first-time setup with dependency installation:*
   ```bash
   make quick-start
   ```

3. **Verify everything is running**
   ```bash
   make status
   make health
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8080
   - MailHog (email testing): http://localhost:8025

> 📖 **Important**: Follow the [Development Process](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md) for the complete standard workflow. This prevents common issues like 404 errors and service conflicts.

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development environment (background)
make dev-bg

# Check service status
make status

# View logs
make logs

# Run all tests
make test

# Run E2E tests
make test-e2e

# Stop all services
make stop
```

For detailed commands, see [`docs/MAKEFILE_COMMANDS.md`](docs/MAKEFILE_COMMANDS.md).

2. Run `make check-deps` to verify tools
3. Run `make quick-start` for full setup
4. Use `make dev-bg` for daily development

### Database Management
```bash
# Run migrations
make db-migrate

# Reset database (clean slate)
make db-reset
```

### Common Workflows
```bash
# After pulling changes
make stop && make install && make db-migrate && make dev-bg

# Debugging issues
make status && make health && make logs

# Before committing
make fmt && make lint && make test
```

### Troubleshooting
